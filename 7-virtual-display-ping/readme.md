In this example I installed Fedora in the vm onto a virtual disk (have been using live ISO until now)

I ssh into the lost running it in "run level 3"

I start a VM that does not have any display configuration, they share a hard drive image, ping it, shut it down

I then start my VM that requests PCI passthrough, and attempt the same thing

The VM is not responsive so it doesn't boot


Manjaro 5.17
